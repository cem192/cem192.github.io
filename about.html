      <h2>The Simple Version</h2>
      <p>Originally from Moreno Valley, CA, Candice spent five years living in New York City where she studied at New York University and became a tenured teacher with the New York City Department of Education.  Her passion in the classroom centers on creating safe spaces for students frequently marginalized in public settings. As an instructor, her solitary role is to create lifelong inquiry driven thinkers through the mediums of reading and writing.  Outside of the classroom, Candice spent many years working with education organizations both on the nonprofit and foundation side as a means to create equitable opportunities for students of all backgrounds. </p>

      <p>Teaching is not Candice’s only passion and the lifelong storyteller within her loves to express itself in the written form. Her work centralizes around being African American in non-inclusive spaces where the protagonists are forced to navigate the lines between the internal self and the external world. Currently, she is working on her thesis at the University of Miami where she is pursuing an MFA in Creative Writing: Fiction. The short story collection tentatively entitled, “Marguerite” will explore the history of modern day Louisiana Creoles balancing the fine line between ethnicity and the monolithic boundaries of race.</p>
